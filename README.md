# Egyptian-Speed

## Im recreating the Egyptian Speed card game from scratch

### Functionality to Add

- Slapping Doubles (this will end the turn and the pot automatically goes to the player that slapped the doubles first)

#### Known Issues

- pot is not returning to the players/bots hand after each round win.
- when a face card is played it should trigger a turn switch, right now you place down all cards based on the "times_to_place" variable, then switch turns. 
- its come to my realization that recreating this type of game is hard because it's mostly a game of luck. The only thing you can do to change the course of the game is by slapping doubles
