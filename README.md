# Egyptian-Speed

## Im recreating the Egyptian Speed card game from scratch

### Functionality to Add

- Slapping Doubles (this will end the turn and the pot automatically goes to the player that slapped the doubles first)

#### Known Issues

- cards are getting appeneded to the pot as strings instead of the card class
- sometimes its working and sometimes it breaks
- somtimes the self.pot.clear() function works and other times it doesnt. Not sure what the issue is
- its come to my realization that recreating this type of game is hard because it's mostly a game of luck. The only thing you can do to change the course of the game is by slapping doubles
